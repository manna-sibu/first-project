                            Supreme Court ordered that all private hospitals that have availed land at concessional
                            rates, must provide
                            free treatment to people falling below poverty line- with no cap on costs.
                            <br>
                            The hospital may make arrangements to meet costs from sponsorships or endorsements,
                            but at no point can the patient be billed.
                            <br>
                            City hospitals to reserve 25% of their out-patient department capacity and
                            10% of their beds at indoor levels for free treatment of the poor.
                            <br>
                            The court was hearing a plea filed by Social Jurists, a civil society group that alleged
                            that three hospitals -
                            Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Hospital, Moolchand and St Stephen's – did not comply with the high
                            court's March 2007 order.
                            <br>
                            The high court pronounced the judgment on a PIL seeking implementation of the land lease
                            agreement between the
                            government and the hospitals for providing, among other things, free treatment to certain

                            - Monitoring Committee of which I am a member inspected three private hospitals, namely,
                            Delhi ENT Hospital & Research Centre, Jasola, GujarmalModi Hospital, Saket and Max Super
                            Specialty Hospital,
                            Saket on Monday November 08, 2011. The Committee noted that in ENT Hospital & Research
                            Centre, a female patient
                            whose family monthly income was less than Rs.6422/- was admitted in the paid category
                            whereas all the three free
                            beds were lying vacant. The Committee advised the Hospital that the concerned patient must
                            be converted in free
                            category and the money deposited (Rs.2500/-) be refunded. It was found that 6 free beds out
                            of 10 were lying vacant
                            in GujarmalModi Hospital whereas 26 free beds out of 30 were lying vacant in Max Super
                            Specialty Hospital.
