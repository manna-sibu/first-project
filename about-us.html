                                the discrimination
                                faced by the under privileged at private hospitals in the city. We are a team of young
                                professionals
                                across various industries who feel there is a lack of accurate information and awareness
                                about
                                what the law stipulates and the ground reality.

            <p>
                Private hospitals in Delhi have been allotted prime land for Rs 1 an acre as against a
                market value of 20 - 80 crores an acre,
                in return for this, the government made it compulsory for them to offer 10 % beds with ALL
                MEDICINES & TESTS INCLUDED and
                25% of all OPD-consultation with doctors to be free.
                Charitybeds, helps all under privileged people achieve healthcare even when they have no
                money.
                A lot of private hospitals have joined hands with us and are actually working with us
                to fulfil their
                social responsibility. We do not charge anything, our only role is to facilitate and save
                lives, wherever we can.
            </p>


            <p>
                We help patients when someone calls us, we go to government hospitals and pick up patients
                from there,
                we help people reaching private hospitals directly. We help people who have BPL ( Below the
                poverty line) cards and
                people who do not have any card as they are not aware because they are so poor.
            </p>


            <p>

                journalists, post on Facebook,
                let us get the message out. Everyday, inspite of all our efforts, only 400 out of 653 free
                beds get utilised, everyday,
                someone dies because they did not have money to buy medicines or get medical care. We are
                racing against time,
                help us to reach more people. It is the least we can do for this country. As of now, we
                operate only in Delhi but
                patients can come for any part of India and seek our assistance.
                We soon plan to be in Mumbai where most of the trusts which run hospitals actually do not
                support any
                free healthcare inspire of sitting on government land worth crores.
            </p>
